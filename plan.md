Great! Here’s a concise but complete structured **implementation plan** you can hand directly to an LLM to write your Python program clearly and efficiently:

---

## **Implementation Plan for Morse Code Practice Program (Python)**

### **Objective:**
Create a simple command-line Python program to practice Morse code exchanges specifically for **Parks on the Air (POTA)** events. It will use Farnsworth timing and generate audio beeps via high-accuracy audio libraries.

---

## **1. Project Requirements:**

- **Programming Language:** Python (latest stable version)
- **Runtime Environment:** Terminal-based (no GUI)
- **Audio Generation Libraries:** `pygame`, `sounddevice` (for accurate audio timing)
- **Timing Accuracy:** High precision (use `pygame.time` or `time.perf_counter` if necessary)
- **Morse Timing:** Implement configurable **Farnsworth timing**
  - Two variables clearly defined at the top of the script:
    - `DIT_DAH_WPM` = Speed of individual dits/dahs (e.g., 20 WPM)
    - `OVERALL_WPM` = Overall effective speed considering extra spacing (e.g., 10 WPM)
- **Exchange Patterns:** Hardcoded as given below
- **Audio Output:** Simple synthesized audio beep tones (no external files)
- **Display Option:** Command-line argument (`--show-text`) toggles immediate display of words right after each word finishes playing. Default is off.
- **No User Interaction:** Runs uninterrupted based solely on startup parameters.

---

## **2. Morse Exchange Patterns:**

Hardcode the following patterns exactly as provided. Use clearly defined example variables at the top of the script:

```python
activator_calls = ["KI5RCF", "N1ABC"]
hunter_calls = ["W1XYZ"]
signal_reports = ["599"]
names = ["JOHN"]
locations = ["CA", "WA"]
park_ids = ["K-1234"]

exchange_patterns = [
    # Basic exchange
    [
        f"CQ POTA DE {activator_call} {activator_call} K",
        f"{hunter_call} DE {activator_call} GM UR {signal_report} {signal_report} NAME {name} {name} QTH {location} {location} AT PARK {park_id} {park_id} K",
        f"{activator_call} DE {hunter_call} TU UR {signal_report} {signal_report} NAME IS BOB QTH NY 73 K",
        f"{hunter_call} DE {activator_call} TU FOR CONTACT 73 K",
    ],

    # Alternate pattern
    [
        f"CQ POTA {activator_call} {park_id} K",
        f"{activator_call} DE {hunter_call} {hunter_call} K",
        f"{hunter_call} GM UR {signal_report} FROM {park_id} {name} K",
        f"R R TU {name} UR {signal_report} DE {hunter_call} 73",
        f"73 TU {hunter_call} QRZ POTA DE {activator_call} K"
    ],
]
```

---

## **3. Farnsworth Timing Implementation Details:**

- Clearly compute these derived variables at startup based on Farnsworth timing rules:
    - **Dot duration (`dit`)** at `DIT_DAH_WPM`
    - **Dash duration (`dah`)** = 3 × dot duration
    - **Intra-character gap** = 1 dot
    - **Inter-character gap** computed to achieve desired effective `OVERALL_WPM`
    - **Word gap** computed similarly to ensure overall effective WPM
- Clearly comment these computations in code for easy future tweaking.

---

## **4. Audio Generation (pygame/sounddevice):**

- **Generate sine-wave tones** at 700 Hz frequency (standard Morse tone frequency)
- **Audio output** clearly encapsulated in one or two simple functions:
    ```python
    play_dot()
    play_dash()
    ```
- Ensure very short latency between tones to maintain precise Morse timing.

---

## **5. Program Flow:**

1. Parse command-line arguments (`--show-text` optional).
2. Initialize audio (pygame & sounddevice).
3. Iterate through each exchange pattern:
    - Break pattern into words, then into letters.
    - Encode letters into Morse symbols.
    - Play Morse audio tone according to Farnsworth timings.
    - Immediately after a **word** is completed (if `--show-text` set), print that word clearly in terminal.
4. Brief pause (~2-3 seconds) after each entire exchange before continuing.

---

## **6. Example CLI Invocation:**

```bash
python pota_morse.py --show-text
```

- `--show-text` optional; if omitted, text is not displayed.

---

## **7. Constraints (to keep it simple):**

- **No** external files or configuration beyond what’s mentioned.
- **No** interactive user controls.
- **No** visual Morse representation required.
- **No** randomization beyond provided patterns.
- **No** future extensibility needed for now.

Please review this structured implementation plan carefully. Once you confirm, this detailed specification can be passed to an LLM or developer to generate the exact Python code clearly, quickly, and effectively.
